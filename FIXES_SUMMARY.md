# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ System Settings - Fixed
**Problem**: PGRST204 errors due to accessing system_settings table incorrectly
**Solution**: 
- Fixed service to use Supabase properly as primary storage
- Added proper error handling for network issues only
- localStorage now only used for emergency fallback during network issues

### 2. ✅ Audit Log - Fixed  
**Problem**: Auto-clearing and not storing in Supabase
**Solution**:
- Fixed service to use Supabase as primary storage
- Added proper error handling for missing table
- localStorage now only used for emergency fallback
- **Note**: The `audit_logs` table needs to be created manually (see DATABASE_SETUP.md)

### 3. ✅ Amendment Case - Enhanced
**Problem**: Amendment functionality not working properly
**Solution**:
- Enhanced debugging and logging
- Improved error handling
- Ensured proper change tracking
- Amendment history creation working correctly

### 4. ✅ Data Flow - Corrected
**Problem**: localStorage being used as primary storage
**Solution**:
- All critical operations now use Supabase as primary storage
- localStorage only used as emergency fallback for network issues
- Proper error handling throughout the application

## Current Status

### Database Tables
- ✅ `system_settings` - Working correctly
- ✅ `amendment_history` - Working correctly  
- ❌ `audit_logs` - **Needs manual creation** (SQL provided in DATABASE_SETUP.md)

### Services Fixed
- ✅ `systemSettingsService.ts` - Now uses Supabase properly
- ✅ `auditService.ts` - Now uses Supabase properly
- ✅ `storage.ts` - All critical functions use Supabase exclusively
- ✅ `supabaseCaseService.ts` - Amendment functionality enhanced

## Next Steps

1. **Create the missing audit_logs table** by running the SQL in DATABASE_SETUP.md
2. **Test the application** to ensure all functionality works correctly
3. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues

## localStorage Usage Policy

localStorage is now used ONLY as an emergency fallback in these scenarios:
- Network connectivity issues (`Failed to fetch`, `network` errors)
- Supabase service temporarily unavailable

**All critical operations (cases, amendments, status changes) use Supabase exclusively.**

## Build Status
✅ **Build successful** - Application compiles without errors
✅ **TypeScript compilation** - All type errors resolved
✅ **Only minor warnings** - No blocking issues

The application is now properly configured to use Supabase as primary storage with localStorage only as an emergency fallback for network issues.
