## üßπ Data Management

### Orphaned Data Cleanup
When departments or countries are modified in Country-Based Code Tables, the system provides comprehensive cleanup utilities:

#### Using Data Cleanup Service
```typescript
import { DataCleanupService } from './src/utils/dataCleanupService';

// Preview what would be cleaned (dry run)
const preview = await DataCleanupService.previewCleanup('Singapore');
console.log(preview.summary);

// Run actual cleanup
const report = await DataCleanupService.runCleanup('Singapore', 'General');
console.log(`Cleaned ${report.cleanedCases} cases and ${report.cleanedUsers} users`);
```

#### Cleanup Features
- **Orphaned Case Detection**: Find cases referencing deleted departments
- **User Department Validation**: Clean invalid user department assignments  
- **Automatic Fallback**: Assign valid departments when cleaning orphaned data
- **Country-Specific Operations**: Clean data for specific countries or globally
- **Preview Mode**: See what would be cleaned before executing
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive reports of all cleanup operations

#### Data Consistency Handling
The system gracefully handles scenarios where:
- Departments are deleted from Country-Based Code Tables
- Countries are removed from the system
- Procedure types are modified or removed
- Users have invalid department assignments

All components include fallback mechanisms and will not crash when referenced data is missing.
