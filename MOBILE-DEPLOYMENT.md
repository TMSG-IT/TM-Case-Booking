   # Deploy to Vercel
   ```

### User Installation:

- Browser shows "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
- App installs like a native app
- Works offline, full-screen experience

## 📱 Native Mobile Apps

```

### 2. Build Commands
```bash
# Build and sync all platforms
npm run mobile:build

# Open Android Studio to build APK
