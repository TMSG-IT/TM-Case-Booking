# Implementation Summary

## âœ… ALL REQUESTED ISSUES FIXED

### 1. âœ… "Amend Case" Functionality Fixed

  - Eliminated localStorage fallbacks for amendments
  - All amendments now save directly to Supabase with proper error handling

### 2. âœ… Amendment History Display Fixed  
- **Issue**: Amendment history not appearing after successful amendments
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `getSupabaseCases` to automatically load amendment history
  - Enhanced amendment history tracking in `amendment_history` table
  - Proper relationship between cases and their amendment records

### 3. âœ… Department Selection for Amend Case Fixed
- **Issue**: Department selection not respecting user permissions
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented user role-based department filtering in `CaseCard.tsx`
  - Admin/IT users see all departments for their country
  - Regular users only see their assigned departments
  - Proper integration with Code Table Setup for country-specific departments

### 4. âœ… Global Tables Loading Fixed
- **Issue**: Countries not showing in Global Tables
- **Solution**:
  - Added automatic initialization of default global tables
  - Fixed `initializeDefaultGlobalTables` function in `supabaseCodeTableService.ts`
  - Proper error handling and fallback table creation

### 5. âœ… User Management Header Overlap Fixed
- **Issue**: Header overlapping content when scrolling
